## `comfig-custom folder`

- Less particles on explosive weapons
- No backstab sound (probably)

## `cs-0.5`

My hud. Centered elements. Black circle crosshair with red damage indictator

## `_surfaceproperties.vpk`

Makes all footsteps metal

## `cache_remover.bat`

Removes all cache files from the custom folder, makes it look cleaner when adding/updating files.

## `Kill_icons.vpk`

More descriptive kill icons

## `loadouts.vpk`

Adds my resupply/loadout binds.

- Left Arrow ---> Down Arrow
- Loadout A ---> Loadout D
- Left Alt = Resupply

## `ur_fvms_15_AIO`

All in one viewmodel fix, makes floating arms, weird hand placement, and any viewmodel_fov 90+ bug dissapear.

## `vpk.exe`

A vpk maker! I did this a while ago, don't know why and I forgot how but just drag folders into the exe (don't open it) and it'll export a vpk file. Neat!
