Custom Heads-Up Display (HUD) for Team Fortress 2. [Click here for screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/0whDjXr).

#### Installation
Extract the zipped file contents into `Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`.

#### Custom Crosshairs
Custom crosshairs are disabled by default. To enable them, open `flawhud\scripts\hudlayout.res` in a text editor and under `CustomCrosshair` change the values of `visible` and `enabled` from 0 to 1. The default crosshair is a thin circle, to change the style, in the same area change the value of `labelText` to the corresponding crosshair letter found in `flawhud\scripts\TF2Crosshairs.png`.

#### Streamer Mode
If you want extra protection against stream snipers and DDoS attacks while streaming on Twitch or YouTube, you can enable Streamer Mode by clicking on the Incognito icon on the right hand side of the main menu. Streamer Mode hides player names and other information that could let the viewer know where and who you're playing with. This feature uses the game's minmode (`cl_hud_minmode`) and users are advised to remove minmode from their configs if they don't want this feature to be enalbed by default.

#### Code Pro Fonts
To enable the Code Pro fonts, open `flawhud\resource\clientscheme.res` and add the suffix `_pro` as instructed in the file.

#### Transparent Viewmodels
Due to users experiencing issues relating to their own graphics settings, the config necessary to use Transparent Viewmodels in-game will not be included. The material files and entry in hudlayout.res (disabled by default) are included, so the user is responsible for acquiring and modifying their config accordingly.
